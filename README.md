CSC345-projects
===============

Three Projects from CSC345 Discrete Structures at UofA implemented in Java  
This repo only contains my own code so most if it will seem useless; 
the professor provided his own files that call the methods I implement

BST-AVL-LHT
---------------

An implementation of a binary search tree, AVL tree (height-balanced binary tree), and linear hash table.

FlightSchedule
---------------

A Flight Scheduler that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to quickly find shortest paths between a large number of airports.

Polynomial
---------------

An implementation of polynomials (e.g. x^5 + 3x^3 + 4).
